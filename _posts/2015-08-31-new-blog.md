We've been working hard at creating charms and bundles to make it easy to deploy
[Apache Hadoop][] and other Big Data tools using Juju and to connect those tools
together to create Big Data solutions, but we haven't really had a great way to
talk about the work we've been doing.  So, this is our new blog where we will
rectify that.

This is just a short intro post, for now, but we have a much more in-depth
discussion coming of the various bundles we've already created and what they
can do, and one in particular that really show-cases what you can do now with
Juju and Big Data, from ingestion through processing and visualization.

Until then, welcome to Juju Big Data.
