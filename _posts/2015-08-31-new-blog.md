We've been hard at work creating charms to make it easy to deploy
[Apache Hadoop][] and other Big Data services using Juju. We've also bundled
these charms together to create Big Data solutions, but we haven't
had a great way to talk about our work. So, this is our new blog where we
will rectify that.

This is just a short intro post for now, but we have much more in-depth
discussions coming of what our various bundles can do. One in particular
really showcases what you can do with Juju and Big Data, from ingestion
through processing, and visualization.

Until then, welcome to Juju Big Data.
