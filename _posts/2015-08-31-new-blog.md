We've been hard at work creating charms to make it easy to deploy
[Apache Hadoop][] and other Big Data services using Juju. We've also bundled
these services together to create Big Data solutions.  But until now, we haven't
really had a great way to talk about the work we've been doing.  So, this is our
new blog where we will rectify that.

This is just a short intro post for now, but we have much more in-depth
discussions coming of what our various bundles can do, and one in particular
that really show-cases what you can do with Juju and Big Data, from ingestion
through processing, and visualization.

Until then, welcome to Juju Big Data.
